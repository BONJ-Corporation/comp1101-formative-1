<h3>Purpose of Computers in Education
</h3>
<p style=text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word>Computers are one of the most valuable resources in a classroom because they serve so many useful functions. With computers and the internet, students today have a wealth of information at their fingertips that can help them develop their research and communication skills while preparing them for a future career in a workforce that is increasingly reliant on computer technology.
Computers also have an important role beyond primary and secondary education classrooms. Thanks to computers and technological advancements, higher education is now more accessible than ever. Many colleges and universities offer online classes, and some even offer degree programs that can be completed exclusively online. Online classes and online degree programs make it easier for single parents or students with heavy workloads to continue their education from the comfort of their own home and at their own pace.

<h3>Online Homework Systems Can Boost Student Achievement</h3>
</div>
<div class=row>
<p style=text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word>Online homework has great appeal for instructors, especially those teaching large courses. By using online assignments, instructors donâ€™t have to collect, grade, and promptly return large quantities of homework assignments. Online programs provide instructors with feedback on student performance that can be used to modify the presentation of material in class. Online homework is also beneficial to students. They get feedback promptly, even more promptly than that provided by very conscientious instructors. Online homework can also be designed so that it allows students to work on areas that frequently cause trouble and/or on areas where the individual student is having difficulty.<br>Source: <a href=https://www.facultyfocus.com/articles/course-design-ideas/online-homework-systems-can-boost-student-achievement/>Maryellen Weimer, PhD, www.facultyfocus.com</a></p>
