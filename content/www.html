    <h1>The World Wide Web</h1>
          

    <p>The world wide web has revolutionised society with unparalelled information sharing and communication <br>  speed.
    Never before was it possible to send information from London to New York in a matter of seconds<br>
    allowing for greater collaberation between geographic locations and faster sharing of technoloigies</p>

    <h3>Use cases:</h3>
    <ul class="list-group">
        <li class="list-group-item">Transfer of financial data</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Social communication</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Technology sharing</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How it works:</h3><br>
    <p>A system of hypertext documents (HTML) are interlinked together through the internet, allowing for the<br>
    display of information on the webpages we know today</p><br>

    <p>Originally web pages were very basic but with increacingly complex CSS, JavaScript and a variety of <br>
    web frameworks allow for much more elegant pages to be created, while not overly impacting load times.<br>
    As a result the web is a much more powerful place for information sharing and enterprise.</p>
