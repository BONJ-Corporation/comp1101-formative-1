<h1>The World Wide Web</h1><br>

<p>The world wide web has revolutionised society with unparalelled information sharing and communication <br>  speed.
Never before was it possible to send information from London to New York in a matter of seconds<br>
allowing for greater collaberation between geographic locations and faster sharing of technoloigies</p>

<h3>Use cases:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Social communication</li>
    <li>Transfer of financial data</li>
    <li>Technology sharing</li>
    
</ul>

<h3>How it works:</h3><br>
<p>A system of hypertext documents (HTML) are interlinked together through the internet, allowing for the<br>
display of information on the webpages we know today</p><br>

<p>Originally web pages were very basic but with increacingly complex CSS, JavaScript and a variety of <br>
web frameworks allow for much more elegant pages to be created, while not overly impacting load times.<br>
As a result the web is a much more powerful place for information sharing and enterprise.</p>
