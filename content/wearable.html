            <h3>Wearable tech for the visually impaired</h3>
            <p>
                Researchers have created a wearable computer to aid the blind, and help reduce collision risk.
                <br/>
                The computer consists of a small mainboard and several cameras which allow it to detect objects around the wearer, when used in conjunction with a guide dog, it is reportedly 40% effective at preventing collisions
